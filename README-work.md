### Update and see the changes in default project

In App.js, just updated the below lines and now when you access 

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hello, happy learning react!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Create a new Person Component

When you now access `npm start` and the app at `http://localhost:3000`, you will see the text has changed.
